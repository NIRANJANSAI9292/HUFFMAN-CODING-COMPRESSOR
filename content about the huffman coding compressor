Title: Huffman Coding for File Compression
Subtitle: Efficient Text Compression using Huffman Encoding

Slide 2: Introduction
Subtitle: What is Huffman Coding?

Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.
It assigns variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequency.
More frequent characters get shorter codes, reducing overall file size.
Slide 3: How Huffman Coding Works
Subtitle: Key Steps in Huffman Encoding

Calculate character frequencies in the input text.
Build a min-heap (priority queue) from character frequencies.
Construct a Huffman tree using a greedy approach.
Generate Huffman codes for each character.
Encode the text using the generated codes.
Save the encoded output to a file.
Slide 4: Huffman Tree Construction
Subtitle: Creating the Huffman Tree

Start with leaf nodes for each character.
Extract two nodes with the smallest frequencies.
Merge them into a new node with combined frequency.
Repeat until only one node (root) remains.
The tree structure determines binary codes.
Slide 5: Example of Huffman Encoding
Subtitle: Encoding a Simple Text
Example: "ABBCCCDDDD"

Frequencies: A(1), B(2), C(3), D(4)
Huffman Tree assigns shorter codes to more frequent characters.
Encoded output: 1100111010100 (example)
Slide 6: Implementation Overview
Subtitle: Code Structure Breakdown

MinHeapNode Structure: Stores characters and frequencies.
Min Heap Operations: Insert, extract minimum, heapify.
Huffman Tree Construction: Merging nodes to form the tree.
Code Storage: Storing Huffman codes in an array.
File Compression: Converting input text to encoded form.
Slide 7: Time Complexity Analysis
Subtitle: Complexity of Each Step

Building Frequency Table: O(n)
Creating Min-Heap: O(n log n)
Building Huffman Tree: O(n log n)
Generating Codes: O(n)
Encoding the File: O(n)
Writing Output: O(n)
Overall Complexity: O(n log n)

Slide 8: File Compression & Results

Slide 9: Advantages & Limitations
Subtitle: Pros and Cons of Huffman Coding
✅ Advantages:

Lossless compression (no data loss).
Efficient for text-based data.
Simple and effective tree-based approach.
❌ Limitations:

Not optimal for very small files.
Requires preprocessing (frequency calculation).
Static Huffman coding does not adapt dynamically.
Slide 10: Conclusion & Applications
Subtitle: Where is Huffman Coding Used?

File Compression (ZIP, GZIP)
Image & Video Encoding (JPEG, MP3)
Network Data Transmission (Efficient Packet Encoding)
Compiler Optimization (Token Compression)
Huffman Coding is a fundamental technique for efficient storage and transmission of data.
