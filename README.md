# HUFFMAN-CODING-COMPRESSOR
C implementation of Huffman coding for lossless file compression. Uses frequency analysis and a min-heap to build optimal prefix codes, reducing file size by 20-50%. Supports all ASCII characters, outputs compressed.txt with codes, and shows compression stats (original vs compressed size).
